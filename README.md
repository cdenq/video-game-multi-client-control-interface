## My WoW Multiboxing Software

`My WoW Multiboxing Software` is a collection of all my old custom AutoHotkey multiboxing scripts for videogame World of Warcraft (WoW). This builds upon an older script written in HotkeyNet (defunct). These date back to 2015 or so, before I ever took any formal lessons in coding. Everything here a product of self-teaching, albeit done poorly.

NOTE: I no longer multibox nor do I play WoW. This is "necro-upload" in case anyone finds it interesting or wants to use it for WoW Classic etc. etc.

For those unfamiliar, `multiboxing` software is that which takes ONE human input, optionally converts it, and then broadcasts it ONCE to MANY game instances. Example) I press `W` to move forward, my multiboxing software converts that input into `Up Arrow`, and then sends `Up Arrow` one time to 2 other instances of my game. I have effectively moved 3 characters forward at the same time.

For a skilled multiboxer, this allows one human player to control multiple characters simulatenously in near-sychronized coordination, which provides advantages to ingame content.

This is NOT the same as botting, which takes ZERO human inputs and broadcasts keys MANY times to MANY game instances (automation).
